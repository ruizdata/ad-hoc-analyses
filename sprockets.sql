Background

We operate a sprocket marketplace that sells hundreds of millions of different sprockets on behalf of a large number of providers to a North American customer base. A
customer order may include a varying set of sprockets from a variety of providers. The price of sprockets changes frequently so we update their prices and track those
changes in a change log that is over a billion records. Due to overwhelming demand for our sprockets, our database is pushed to its limits during the business day processing millions of orders during our peak hours of operation.

Task 1: Querying data
A provider (ID: 1024) has asked for a report of their top 25 (in purchase total) customers from the past three months.

Describe how you would approach fulfilling this request.
Write the query.
